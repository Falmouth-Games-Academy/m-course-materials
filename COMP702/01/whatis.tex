\begin{frame}{What is AI?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item[\xmark] Simulating human brains or human intelligence
        \pause\item[\cmark] Performing tasks by machine (or by software) which would ordinarily require human intelligence
        \pause\item[\cmark] Making decisions to achieve goals
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is AI?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item[\xmark] Programming machines to learn by themselves
        \pause\item[\cmark] Machine learning is an important sub-field of AI, but there are many other AI techniques
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is AI?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item[\xmark] Programming machines to possess general intelligence, self-awareness, consciousness
        \pause\item[\cmark] Maybe one day, but for now this is pure sci-fi
        \pause\item[\cmark] Programming machines to carry out (or learn to carry out) a specific type of task
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is classical AI?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item A.k.a. \textbf{Good Old Fashioned AI}
        \pause\item A.k.a. \textbf{Symbolic AI}
        \pause\item Based on symbolic (``human-readable'') representations of problems, logical systems, search spaces
        \pause\item As opposed to machine learning, evolutionary algorithms etc which tend to be ``black boxes''
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Applications of AI in games}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Enemies and other NPCs
		\pause\item Opponents in $\{$board, card, strategy$\}$ games
		\pause\item Automated playtesting
		\pause\item Directors, hints, adaptive difficulty
		\pause\item Procedural content generation
		\pause\item Content production tools
		\pause\item Procedural narrative
		\pause\item Agent-based simulations
		\pause\item ...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why game AI?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Games are a useful testbed for new AI technologies
		\pause\item Game theory is a useful mathematical abstraction for many types of problem
		\pause\item Game AI is more than pure problem solving --- game AI needs to create an entertaining experience
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
